## About

Hi! I'm Alex Tang, and I'm a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics from Charlotte, NC. 

I spent this past summer as a software engineer intern for CommScope, a network infrastructure company, working with agentic AI systems and Model Context Protocol to develop in-house solutions. 

In my free time, I like watching movies and playing video games. My favorite movie is Everything Everywhere All At Once, and I'm currently playing through Pokemon Legends Z-A. This semester, my goal is to add at least 20 movies to my Letterboxd.

I'm very excited to be one of your UTAs, and I'm looking forward to a great semester!
