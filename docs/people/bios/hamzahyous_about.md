## About

Hi, my name is Hamzah Yousuf and I am a junior at Chapel Hill studying Computer Science. I took this course in Spring 2025 as a sophomore and enjoyed learning the industry grade SWE tooling and best practices. When I interned over the summer as a software engineer, the learning from this class made the onboarding process much smoother. 

This is my first semester as a UTA, and I could not be more excited to dig through some of the core content again, help students with any questions they may have, and learn the new content this course will introduce this semester!

Outside of school, I enjoy biking (biked the 32-mile Tobacco trail over winter break!), playing soccer, as well as tennis.
