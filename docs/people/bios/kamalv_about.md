## About

Hi! I'm Kamal, a third year student at UNC-Chapel Hill from Charlotte, NC pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

This past semester, I was an software engineering intern at Cognizant, a tech consulting company, where I helped build a automated tool to write tests for products that we were working on. Outside of school, I like to play tennis, go rock climbing, and binge tv shows.

Looking forward to a great semester working with all of you!
