## About

Hi! My name is Julia Guzzo, and I am a senior studying Computer Science with a Data Science minor. This will be my fourth semester as as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the CS Department. Before this semester, I was a UTA for COMP 110 and COMP 433.

This past summer, I was a SWE intern at Apple, where I worked on an internal macOS app designed to reduce friction in the code integration workflow. I have also been a member of App Team Carolina for 4 semesters, where I learned iOS development, served as an iOS developer for the Carolina Food Pantry app, and led the iOS Apprenticeship Learning Team. 

COMP 423 has been my favorite class I've taken here at UNC, so I'm really excited to finish out my time at Carolina as a COMP 423 UTA!
