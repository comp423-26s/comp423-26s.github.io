## About

Hey everyone! I’m Benny Rakower, a senior at UNC majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration from Westchester, NY.

This past summer I was a Software Engineer intern at Major League Baseball, working on some of the components found on MLB.com.

I’m really into building things — especially web apps that have impact and can be used by the people around me. When I’m not coding, you can find me playing poker, playing/watching sports, practicing guitar, or traveling. 

I’m excited to be a TA for this class and looking forward to a fun and interesting semester!
