## About

Hello! I'm Charlotte, and I'm a junior from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am currently studying Computer and Data Science student. Previous to 423, I have TA'ed for COMP 110 and COMP 426. This past summer, I interned at SAS as a software engineer intern where I got to apply many of the skills and technology I learned throughout 426 and 423.

Aside from academics, I enjoy climbing, hiking, video games, and crocheting!
