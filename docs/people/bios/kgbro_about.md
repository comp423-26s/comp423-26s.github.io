## About

Hi, my name is Katie Brown! I'm a junior from Montgomery, AL studying computer science and information science. I'm interested in full stack development, pursuing software engineering, and before joining 423, I TA'd for COMP110!  

Outside of class, I enjoy hiking, painting, live music, and hanging out with my friends!
