## About

Hello! My name is Kris Jordan. I'm in my 11th year teaching at UNC. Prior to that I was a founder and technical director of New Media Campaigns, attended Brown University for graduate school, and earned my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at... UNC Chapel Hill!

I just returned from a semester teaching abroad in Cape Town South Africa (as pictured) and am so excited to be back in COMP423 Foundations of Software Engineering to introduce you to an ever exciting field. The tools software engineers have available to them today are much more powerful than they were... _one year ago_! It is awesome time to be in an area where we can continue to do things that were impossible a few short years ago.

In the past couple of years I have picked up sailing as a hobby and think it's a great outdoor activity for the engineering-minded.
