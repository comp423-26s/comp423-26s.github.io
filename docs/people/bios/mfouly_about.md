## About

Hi everyone! My name is Muhammad Fouly, and I am in my final semester at UNC. I’m from Charlotte, NC, but was originally born and raised in Egypt. I’m majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and will be returning to Microsoft as a full-time Software Engineer after graduating in May.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and experiencing the beauty the world has to offer.

I’m very excited to be a TA for this class and learn new things along the way!
