## About

Hi! I'm Lizzie Coats, and I'm a junior from Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm a Computer Science and Information Science double major, and prior to joining Team 423 I spent three semesters as a UTA for COMP110. 

I recently returned from an awesome semester abroad in Cape Town, South Africa, where I worked as a software engineer intern at RLabs, an international social enterprise. There, I helped develop a web app for a United Nations-recognized platform using many of the tools and skills I learned when I took COMP423 last year!

This semester I'm trying to train for a 10k, find some cool hikes close to Chapel Hill, and start an herb garden in my backyard.
