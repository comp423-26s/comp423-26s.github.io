## About

Hello!! My name is Natalie Ammerman. I'm a senior at UNC majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Neuroscience and Environmental Science and Studies. I took the pilot course for COMP 423 in Fall 2024, so I'm looking forward to seeing how much the course has grown since, and how much it will grow this semester!

This past summer I worked as a Software Engineer intern at Red Hat, where I worked on the OpenShift platform, and I'm very excited to be returning to my team to work full-time after graduation.

Outside of the professional realm, I enjoy going outside in pretty much any format (hiking, biking, running, etc.), traveling, hanging out with my dog, and partaking in music listening, movie watching, and video game playing.
