## About

Hi! My name is Jade Keegan. I'm an MS student in my third and final semester. I completed my undergrad in CS here at UNC as well, where I worked under Kris on the COMP 590 pilot version of this course! Although software engineering is my main interest, this semester I'm excited to also be involved in cryptography research with Saba Eskandarian.

Outside of work and school, I enjoy hiking, baking/cooking, crocheting, drawing, and playing video games with my friends.
