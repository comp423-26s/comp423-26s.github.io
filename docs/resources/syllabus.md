Prerequisite courses: C or better in both COMP301 and COMP211.

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to prepare you for technical leadership by focusing on how teams design, build, and deliver software for people.

Software engineering is a fast-moving field that covers everything from ethics and communication to code and tools. The course is organized around six threads:

1. **Career and Professional Life**
    * You will learn the software engineering code of ethics and how to make and justify decisions ethically.
    * You will practice teaching yourself by evaluating tools, reading documentation, using AI assistants, and experimenting.
    * You will learn about common professional roles and career paths in software development.
    * You will reflect on your goals and practice habits to help you achieve them.
    * You will build a portfolio-grade project with a team to show to future employers.
2. **Collaboration**
    * You will practice technical communication for different audiences, especially your teammates.
    * You will practice using professional collaboration workflows.
    * You will practice using tools designed to help teams build software.
    * You will practice working on a shared codebase with a small team.
3. **Design Process**
    * You will practice solving engineering challenges through a design lens.
    * You will practice analyzing requirements, brainstorming, and making trade-offs.
    * You will practice writing requirements, design documents, and creating wireframes.
    * You will practice working with user personas, stories, and epics.
4. **Production System Design and Operation** 
    * You will learn the main sub-systems of a modern, production-ready application that integrates with databases and AI.
    * You will learn how system components communicate using APIs and protocols.
    * You will practice deploying a production-grade cloud system automatically.
    * You will practice with system concerns like scalability and reliability.
5. **Software Engineering Skills** 
    * You will practice building software that meets design requirements.
    * You will practice making and documenting architectural decisions.
    * You will practice acceptance verification using techniques such as automated testing, continuous integration, and static analysis.
    * You will practice code reviews and pair programming.
    * You will practice contributing to a large, existing codebase.
6. **Tool Bench**
    * You will learn to use fundamental tools such as dependency managers, test harnesses, and linters.
    * You will learn to use AI tools like coding agents and cloud code reviewers.
    * You will practice setting up a professional development environment.
    * You will practice evaluating and choosing the right tools for a job.

These threads will be woven together throughout the semester. We will label activities by thread to help you see how they fit into the big picture.

## Textbooks and Resources

The course website (https://comp423-26s.github.io/) and Canvas are your main resources. There is no required textbook; we will provide all readings and tutorials online.

We may source chapters from the following books. You do not need to buy them, but they are excellent resources for your career:

* The Mythical Man-month, Fred Brooks
* Code Complete 2nd Edition, Steve McConnell
* The Pragmatic Programmer, Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt
* Clean Code and Clean Agile, Robert Martin
* A Philosophy of Software Design, John Ousterhout

## Disclaimer

The instructor may change the syllabus and will announce any changes as early as possible. This semester represents a significant iteration over previous offerings to incorporate AI-enabled software engineering workflows and modern production systems. Expect more frequent updates than in typical courses. Check the course site regularly for changes.

## Modality: In-person

Lecture and office hours are your best resources. Both are in-person only; remote participation is not possible because we focus on group work.

Unlike many CS courses, software engineering is as much about communication and teamwork as it is about programming. You will work in pairs and teams all semester. Being a reliable teammate is critical to your success.

## Course Requirements and Policies

You should attend all lectures and check the course page for updates. Complete all assignments on time.

Please arrive at least five minutes early so class can start on time. Place your bag in the basket under your seat.

## Course Load Expectation

This course is rigorous. Communicating with teammates, reading, designing, and debugging will take significant time. You should expect to spend 3 hours in lecture and about 9 hours per week working outside of class.

We do not recommend taking COMP423 if you are enrolled in 17 or more credit hours.

## Grading Criteria

To do well, you must participate in class, be a professional and productive teammate, keep up with assignments, and write verifiably acceptable software.

Your final grade will depend heavily on peer evaluations of your work on the team project and paired tasks.

Final grades are weighted as follows:

* 15% - (LS) Lesson Attendance and Participation
* 20% - Homework
    * 10% - (TK) Tasks
    * 10% - (RD) Readings & Professional Development
* 20% - (QZ) Quizzes
* 25% - Project Sprints (SP) / Final Project (FN)
    * 5% - SP00 - Sprint 0
    * 5% - SP01 - Sprint 1
    * 5% - SP02 - Sprint 2
    * 10% - Final Presentation and Hand-in
* 20% - (FN) Final Exam

### Lesson (Class Attendance) Policy

We follow UNC's official [Attendance, Grading, and Examination](https://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/attendance-grading-examination/) policies.

You can miss up to four (4) classes without penalty or needing approval. After four absences, further missed classes will lower your participation grade unless they are university-approved.

### Regrade Requests

You have 48 hours to request a regrade after a grade is posted. Review your work first to understand any mistakes. If we graded something incorrectly, submit a request on Gradescope for that specific question. Do not use regrade requests to ask why something is wrong; come to office hours instead.

### Late policies

Class assignments are due by the end of the lesson on Gradescope.

Other assignments are due at 10:00pm on their due date.

Assignments with 10:00pm deadlines have a 2-hour grace period. After that, a 15% penalty applies. The late period lasts 48 hours.

#### Slip Days

We will drop the late penalties for your first four late assignments. This only removes the penalty; it does not count for assignments you don't turn in. We expect you to hand everything in!

### Grading Scale Breakdown

- A: 94-100
- A-: 90-94
- B+: 87-89
- B: 83-86
- B-: 80-82
- C+: 77-79
- C: 73-76
- C-: 70-72
- D: 60-69
- F: 59 or below

Grades will be rounded up if the fraction is greater than 0.499.

### Office Hour Expectations

Office hours are a great way to get help. We use the CSXL app to manage the queue; you will be enrolled automatically.

Office hours are **in-person in Sitterson Hall SN136**. Check the CSXL app for the current schedule.

To help our TAs support everyone, please follow these guidelines:

* TAs can help you for up to **20 minutes per day**. This ensures everyone gets help and encourages you to try solving problems on your own or with teammates first. Solving problems yourself is a vital skill for any engineer.

* Please write **thoughtful** help tickets. Explain the problem in detail and what you have already tried. We will help you make progress, but we may ask you to try reasoning through new problems on your own before returning.

### Final Project Presentations

Instead of a final exam, teams will present and demo their projects during the scheduled final exam period.

### Final Project Licensing Agreement

You will work in a team of four to build a feature for an open-source project used by UNC CS students. We hope to merge the best projects into the production codebase. Because of this, your work will be licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and you will receive proper credit for your contributions.

## Honor Code and Collaboration Policy

Software engineering is about teamwork. We encourage you to collaborate with classmates and staff unless an assignment is explicitly marked as individual (like quizzes). The largest part of your grade is a group project. Quizzes are the only part of the course where you cannot collaborate.

**Always cite your collaborators clearly on any work you turn in.**

Do not use LLMs to write text. You may use them to get feedback on your project specifications later in the semester, but for now, we want to see your own writing—especially for reflections.

If you use AI tools for code, you must cite them with a URL. **You must be able to explain any code you turn in.** You don't need to cite official documentation or standard library examples, but you must cite code from StackOverflow, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot.

We follow the "Google Rule": no more than 20% of the lines you add to an assignment should be written with an LLM. Exceeding this will result in a 50% grade deduction for your team.

### Code Review Test

We may ask you to explain any line of code you turned in. **Using code you don't understand is intellectually dishonest.** If you cannot explain your work, your grade will be penalized, and you may be reported to the honor court.

## Feedback

If you have suggestions or want to thank the TAs, please [give us feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQMteEvnQpBfGsAYP5TpuqokQenhZUIf8CNvfAUUZEjMCWZQ/viewform). We are happy to make improvements when we can!

## Diversity Statement

The instructor and the undergraduate teaching assistant team value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. We broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. We strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve; we appreciate suggestions.

## Title IX Resources
