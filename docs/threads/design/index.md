# Software Design

Before writing code, you must understand the "why", "how", and "for who?" This thread covers requirements analysis, writing technical design documents, and working within Agile processes.

Learning to analyze requirements and document plans before you build ensures that your work aligns with user needs and organizational goals. This is a critical skill for moving into senior-level roles where planning is as important as execution, if not more.

We will learn more about software design as the course builds up.
