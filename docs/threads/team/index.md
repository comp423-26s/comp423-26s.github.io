# Tools and Processes for Teams

This thread focuses on successful collaboration in software contexts. It covers project management software, source code pull request (PR) workflows, and code review (CR) practices.

Software engineering is a team sport. Companies value engineers who can collaborate and communicate at high levels of competence. Being a capable team member who can use the tools and practice the processes of collaboration will help you integrate into high-performing teams and thrive.

We will address teamwork concerns as we move further into the semester.
