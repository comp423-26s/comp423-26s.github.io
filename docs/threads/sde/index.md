# Software Engineering Skills

This thread moves beyond "just making it work." You will verify software meets business requirements, practice conducting professional code reviews, and documenting technical choices using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). 

These skills are what separate a "coder" from an "engineer." By learning how to verify quality and communicate your work with appropriate documentation, you help teams maintain a healthy codebase.
