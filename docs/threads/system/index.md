# System Design

This is the "big picture" view of software components coming together to form a production system. In this thread you will learn how the front end, back end, database (persistence), and other production/cloud components are orchestrated to create a functioning system.

Understanding how systems of components interact allows you to build applications that are fast, secure, and capable of handling many users. In the industry, system design knowledge is essential for architecting modern platforms and is a major focus of high-level engineering interviews.

System design concerns will pick-up as we get deeper into the course.
