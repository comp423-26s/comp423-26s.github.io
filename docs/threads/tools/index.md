# Tool Bench for Individual Contributors (IC)

You will learn the essential tools that modern software engineers use to write, test, and package their code, including Git, containers (Docker), automated test runners, AI code agents, and more.

Mastering a professional tool bench makes you more capable and productive. It helps AI agents successfully contribute to your projects, too. In industry, understanding the tools in your development environment means you can spend more time solving complex problems with the best tools for the job and less time fighting with your developer setup or taking on jobs with the wrong tools for them.
